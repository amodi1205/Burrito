* Step One: Sear chicken seasoned with a homemade Burrito spice mix, then chop it up;
* Step Two: Make burrito filling – sautéed onion, capsicum/bell peppers, refried beans, and add the chicken. The filling should be juicy and wet, but not watery – otherwise it will make the burrito soggy
* Step Three: Pile filling, corn, rice, coriander/cilantro and cheese on a tortilla, then roll up tightly;
* Step Four: Bake or panfry to melt the cheese and warm it all up!
